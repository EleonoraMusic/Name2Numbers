# Name2Numbers
A quite useless but very funny project made with my boyfriend and a dev friend

### The story behind
This project was born by a challange launched by my math-lover boyfriend. 
He asked me to create a quick website to calculate the numerical value of his name. 
Of course the main issue was to develop the JS code (in fact the "graphic side" was not a priority here). 
As a newbie I had to make many online researches and that was still not enough to accomplish my final goal: create a two-pages website where data are transferred from the home page to the result page. 
To resolve the issue I asked for help to a frontend developer friend so this can be definitely considered a 6-hands project.

### Comment
This was really a great challange to me and made me thought of giving everything up and stop coding. But, in the end, I realized 
that I'm really at the very beginning of this amazing journey and that maybe I just need to go on and be umble enough to ask for some help.
